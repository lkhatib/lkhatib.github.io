I am a Ph.D. student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at UC San Diego. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's in psychology and have worked in human subject research for the past four years. My current endeavors center around the application of advanced data science techniques to decipher complex microbiome data, leveraging state-of-the-art DNA sequencing methodologies. This entails harnessing large-scale datasets and employing cutting-edge analytical tools to uncover hidden patterns and insights within the intricate microbial communities. In my previous work, I used various neuroimaging and pharmacological methodologies to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness meditation and psychedelics on well-being. Through my graduate studies, I aspire to continue using my curiosity about the human brain to discover innovative approaches to improving mental health.

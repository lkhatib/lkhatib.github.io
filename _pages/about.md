I am a Senior Research Technician at the [Brain Mechanisms of Pain and Health Laboratory](https://zeidanlab.weebly.com/) at UC San Diego. I have over two years of human subject research experience in behavioral neuroscience, cognitive science, and educational psychology. I am aspiring to pursue a PhD and use my curiosity for the human brain to discover integrative approaches to mental health.

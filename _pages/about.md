I am a Senior Research Technician at the [Brain Mechanisms of Pain and Health Laboratory](https://zeidanlab.weebly.com/) at UC San Diego. We use various neuroimaging and pharmacological methodologies to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness meditation and psychedelics on well-being.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's in psychology and have been working in human subject research for the past two years. My research experience is in behavioral neuroscience, cognitive science, and educational psychology. I aspire to pursue a PhD and use my curiosity for the human brain to discover integrative approaches to improving mental health.

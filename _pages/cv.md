<b>Brain mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based chronic pain relief</b>:
National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health-funded (5 R01 AT009693-05)
randomized clinical trial investigating the brain mechanisms supporting the direct attenuation
of chronic low back pain by mindfulness meditation as compared to placebo-mindfulness
meditation. Activities on this project include but are not limited to:
  * Designing the experiment
  * Data collection via quantitative sensory testing
  * Psychophysical procedure of the radiculopathy inducing straight leg raise test
  * Certified MRI scanner technician
  * Supervise therapeutic interventions
  * Mentored and trained lab personnel to perform data collection
  * General linear modeling of behavioral data
  * Functional brain imaging analyses
  * Patient recruitment and screening

<b>The role of endogenous opioids in mindfulness-based chronic pain relief</b>:
National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health-funded (5 R21 AT010352-02)
randomized clinical trial determining if mindfulness-based chronic pain relief is mediated by
endogenous opioids as compared to placebo-mindfulness. Work on this project include:
  * Data collection via quantitative sensory testing
  * Psychophysical procedure of the radiculopathy inducing straight leg raise test
  * Monitoring patientâ€™s vital signs during intravenous injection of naloxone and saline
  * Mentored and trained lab personnel to perform data collection
  * Leading a team of ten volunteers on patient recruitment and screening
  * Analyzing behavioral data
  * Co-first author of manuscript (in preparation)

<b>The effect of mindfulness training for awake craniotomy patients</b>:
Pilot study testing the efficacy of mindfulness meditation on pain, anxiety, and stress outcomes
during awake craniotomy in glioblastoma patients. Responsibilities entail:
  * Patient recruitment and screening
  * Coordinate and supervise therapeutic interventions
  * Administration of a brief mental state exam before and during awake craniotomy
  * Observe the administration of a series of neuropsychological assessments during the awake portion of the procedure
  * Collect psychological data before, during, and after awake craniotomy
  * Analyzing data and presenting results to a multidisciplinary team of neuroscientists, clinical psychologists, anesthesiologists, and neurosurgeons

<b>Brain mechanisms supporting cannabis-induced analgesia</b>:
Randomized-controlled clinical trial investigating the neural mechanisms underlying vaporized
cannabis-induced acute and chronic pain relief. Current work includes:
  * Helped design the experimental protocol
  * Develop recruitment material, screening scripts, and RedCAP assessments
  * Collect data via psychophysical measures and MRI acquisition
  * Acquiring regulatory approvals

<b>Psilocybin-assisted therapy for phantom limb pain</b>:
Pilot study exploring the effects of psilocybin on patients with amputated limbs. Responsibilities
on this project include:
  * Helped design the experimental protocol
  * Developed recruitment material, screening scripts, and RedCAP assessments
  * Manage recruitment and screening
  * Administration of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
  * Monitor sessions with psilocybin administration

Pilot study that tested the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program for victims
of gun violence. Work on this project included:
  * Helped design the experiment
  * Assisted in Institutional Review Board approvals in a timely fashion
  * Designed pre- and post-intervention assessments
  * Managed participant contact
  * Collected psychological and biological data
  * Analyzed psychological data
  * First-authored manuscript (under review)

<b>Brain mechanisms supporting empathy cultivation, compassion development, and pain-relief by compassion-based mental training</b>:

on empathy and compassion cultivation. Current responsibilities:
  * Helped design the experiment
  * Assisted in Institutional Review Board approvals in a timely fashion
  * Certified MRI technician
  * Data collection via quantitative sensory testing
  * Administration of psychological assessments
  * Analyzing psychological and neuroimaging data

<b>Brain mechanisms supporting cannabis-induced analgesia</b>:
Randomized-controlled clinical trial investigating the neural mechanisms underlying vaporized
cannabis-induced acute and chronic pain relief. Current work includes:
  * Helped design the experimental protocol
  * Develop recruitment material, screening scripts, and RedCAP assessments
  * Collect data via psychophysical measures and MRI acquisition
  * Acquiring regulatory approvals
